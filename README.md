# Giant Handcuff Project
<h2><b>What is this thing?</b></h2><br>
<p>I created the Giant Handcuff Project because I enjoy teaching people about physical security, lockpicking, and bypass techniques. Several manufacturers make a "see-through" handcuff that is greta for demonstrating how handcuffs work and showing the locking mechanism and bypass techniques. However, all these products are the size of a normal handcuff. When teaching a room full of people, I wanted to have something large enough to show to the entire room at once. Since a handcuff is a fairly simple device, I was confident that, even with my noob-ish CAD skills, I could design something that would work for me.<br>

<h2><b>Why would I want to make one??</b></h2>
<p>Ummmmmm.........It's a GIANT FREAKING HANDCUFF!<br>
<br>
<h2><b>How do I make one?</b></h2><br>
<ol>
  <li>Laser cut the DXF files</li>
  <li>Print the 3D printed parts</li>
  <li>Make the spring from steel wire</li>
  <li>Assemble and Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Laser cut the DXF Files</h3>
<p>I had my pieces cut out 1/8" acrylic by a laser cutting service online. It came out a bit flimsy but still definitely useable. I would have liked to do the whole thing out of 1/4" but it was just too expensive. At very least, you may want to consider doing everything except "Bottom Part.DXF" and "Top Part.DXF" out of 1/4". This will give more room for a key or pick to demonstrate the inner workings.
<p>One of each of the files in the DXF folder is needed with the exception of "Spring.DXF". I originally hoped that an acrylic piece could act as a spring, but it didn't seem to have enough strength in 1/8" acrylic. Perhaps if you used something thicker it would work. If you want to have the "Spring.DXF" cut to use as a template for your wire, you can. Otherwise, it is not needed for assembly.<br>

<h3>Print the 3D printed parts</h3>
<p>The files in the STL folder are sized as if all pieces were cut out of 1/8" acrylic. If you use 1/4" for the middle parts or the whole thing, you will need to resize them accordingly. STEP files are included in the STP folder. One day I may get around to doing this and labeling the new STLs accordingly. 
<p>You will need five each of the "Main Hex Female.stl" and "Main Hex Male.stl" and one each of the "Lock Hex Female.stl" and "Lock Hex Male.stl". I printed these in PLA with 3 perimeters and 20% infill. No supports are needed the way they are currently oriented.<br>
