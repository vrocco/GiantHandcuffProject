# Giant Handcuff Project
<b>What is this thing?</b>
The Giant Handcuff Project was created because I enjoy teaching people about physical security, lockpicking, and bypass techniques. Several manufacturers make a "see-through" handcuff that is greta for demonstrating how handcuffs work and showing the locking mechanism and bypass techniques. However, all these products are the size of a normal handcuff. When teaching a room full of people, I wanted to have something large enough to show to the entire room at once. Since a handcuff is a fairly simple device, I was confident that, even with my noob-ish CAD skills, I could design soemthing that would work for me.
