# Giant Handcuff Project
<h3><b>What is this thing?</b></h3><br>
<p>I created the Giant Handcuff Project because I enjoy teaching people about physical security, lockpicking, and bypass techniques. Several manufacturers make a "see-through" handcuff that is greta for demonstrating how handcuffs work and showing the locking mechanism and bypass techniques. However, all these products are the size of a normal handcuff. When teaching a room full of people, I wanted to have something large enough to show to the entire room at once. Since a handcuff is a fairly simple device, I was confident that, even with my noob-ish CAD skills, I could design something that would work for me.<br>

<h3><b>How do I make one?</b></h3><br>
<ol>
  <li>Have the DXF files laser cut</li>
  <li>Print the 3D printed parts</li>
  <li>Assemble and Enjoy!</li>
